![Detail](images/Group%209.png?raw=true)
![Search & Cast](images/Group%2010.png?raw=true)
![Environment](images/Group%2011.png?raw=true)

You can see latest, now play, popular, and coming soon also search movie
then you can see all caster too.

This application get data from [The Movie DB Api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
you can start this project by replacing with your own apiKey at helper/config.dart file

This application also inspired by this design:
- [Movies app](https://dribbble.com/shots/6715286-Movies-app) from [MUSE](https://dribbble.com/siyumiao)
- [Movies app](https://dribbble.com/shots/7365479-Movies-App) from [Lay](https://dribbble.com/humble-designer)

Then I use some of useful widget like this:
- [NestedScrollView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/NestedScrollView-class.html)
- [Salomon Bottom App Bar](https://pub.dev/packages/salomon_bottom_bar)
- [TabBar and TabBarView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TabBar-class.html)
- [Grid View](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GridView-class.html)
